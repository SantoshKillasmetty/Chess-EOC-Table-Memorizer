## Chess Moves APP

You can see a hosted version of `The node.js example app` on <a href="https://the-example-app-nodejs.contentful.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a>.

## Requirements

* Node 8
* Git
* Contentful CLI (only for write access)

Without any changes, this app is connected to a Contentful space with read-only access. To experience the full end-to-end Contentful experience, you need to connect the app to a Contentful space with read _and_ write access. This enables you to see how content editing in the Contentful web app works and how content changes propagate to this app.

```bash
git clone 
cd 
```
